## Motivation

I designed and created a website for a motorbike shop.

The business already had a high traffic domain but was in need of a professional website that converted better. Therefore, I built a clear and trustworthy web page that made it easier for potential customers to contact the business manager directly.

As conversion rates improved, management was in need of a back office to narrow all the requests regarding their actual stock. Due to this, I converted the original HTML files to PHP and created a simple text-based database to upload and update the stock.

## To run the project

`php -S localhost:8000`

Runs the app in the development mode.
